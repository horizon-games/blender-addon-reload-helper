This addon helps make development of other addons simpler, by reloading addons with the press of a button. 

# Getting Started #

## Installation ##
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Install the addon (https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html)
3. Enable the addon titled "System: Addon Reload Helper"

## Usage ##
To reload all addons (brute force for now), either 
* Look in Properties > Scene > Addon Reload Helper and press the big button titled "Reload Addons"
* Press (OSKey + Shift + R)

## Notes ##

The hotkey (OSKey + Shift + R) is specifically written for OSX for now, to mimick hard reloading in web browsers like Chrome.

For fun, you can even use this addon to quickly improve itself, if you clone and Symlink the addon repo directory to your addon folder.
